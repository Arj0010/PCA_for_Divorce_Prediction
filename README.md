# PCA_for_Divorce_Prediction

This project explores the prediction of divorce using a dataset containing answers to 55 questions related to marriage. Factor Analysis is used to understand underlying patterns in the data, which are then utilized for prediction.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of divorce based on responses to various questions about marital life. We apply Factor Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify key factors influencing the outcome.

## Installation
To get started with this project, you'll need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk
```
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 170 entries and 55 features, representing different aspects of a person's relationship with their spouse. The dataset is stored in divorce.csv, and the column names are generated by processing the Divorce_README.txt file using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA section, we:

Checked for missing values: The dataset does not contain any missing values.
Visualized correlation: We plotted a heatmap to understand the correlation between different features.
Descriptive statistics: Analyzed the distribution of responses for each question.

## Factor Analysis
Factor Analysis was used to:

Reduce the number of variables.
Identify latent variables (factors) that explain the observed variables.
Why Factor Analysis?
Unlike PCA, which generates orthogonal components, Factor Analysis allows factors to be correlated. This makes it more suitable for understanding underlying constructs in data where variables may have interdependencies.

## Results
The Factor Analysis identified key latent variables that influence the likelihood of divorce.
The analysis revealed that certain behavioral patterns and attitudes in a relationship are strong predictors of divorce.
